"""
PyMuPDF demo script to generate tangent constructors of mathematical curves
like Cardioid, Nephroid and similar.
This works by putting the points of a regular polygon on a circle's
perimeter and then draw - in clockwise fashion - a line from each point to
a point following 'curve' places after it.
The number 'curve' determines the type of the constructed curve. For a
cardioid ('curve' = 2) we therefore would be doing this:
Draw lines p0 to p2, p1 to p3, p2 to p4, ..., p[n-1] to p1.

Just change the 'curve' value to create a different curve.
